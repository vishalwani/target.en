# Enabling mixed content in your browser{#enabling-mixed-content-in-your-browser}

Mixed content occurs if both HTTPS (secure) *and* HTTP (insecure) content is loaded to display the same web page and the initial request was secure over HTTPS.

Modern browsers might block the display of a page or display warning messages if secure content is mixed with insecure content.

If the [!UICONTROL Visual Experience Composer] (VEC) in [!DNL Target] tries to open a page containing mixed content, a message displays showing how to disable blocking in your browser so you can open an HTTP site or a site that has mixed calls (HTTPS and HTTP).

Previously, when mixed content was not allowed, you could still perform some actions in Step 1 of the three-step guided workflow when creating activities. [!DNL Target] now blocks actions in Step 1. When this message displays, you must enable mixed content before continuing creating the activity.

Your browser's security settings might block mixed content or insecure (HTTP) content being loaded into a secure (HTTPS) page or frame (such as the VEC). If you don't want to disable your browser's security settings, you need to have an HTTPS website.

If you website is running on an insecure (HTTP) domain, you are required to allow the VEC to load active mixed content.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Allowing mixed content affects the VEC only and not your live website.

For more information, see [Mixed Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content) on the *Mozilla Developer Network* (MDN) website.

## Enabling mixed content in Google Chrome {#task_FF297A08F66E47A588C14FD67C037B3A}

If you're visiting a site via a secure connection, Chrome verifies that the content on the web page has been transmitted safely.

See [This page has insecure content](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/1342714?hl=en) in Google Chrome Help.

If you are using the VEC with the latest version of Chrome (version 79.0.3945.117 or later), you need to update your site settings. Visitors to your site do not need to complete these steps.

1. Click the lock or caution icon, then click **[!UICONTROL Site settings]**. 

   ![Site Settings](/help/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/r-troubleshoot-composer/assets/site-settings.png)

1. Scroll to **[!UICONTROL Insecure content]**, then use the drop-down list to change "Block (default)" to "Allow."

1. Reload the VEC page.

## Enabling mixed content in Mozilla Firefox {#task_5448763B8DC941FD80F84041AEF0A14D}

By default, Firebox blocks pages that mix secure and insecure content. It is recommended that you permanently change this setting to use [!DNL Target]. Visitors to your site do not need to complete these steps.

1. In Firefox, enter `about:config` in the address bar.
1. Acknowledge the warning message displayed by Firefox.

1. In the search bar, type `block_active`.

   ![Firefox block active setting](/help/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/r-troubleshoot-composer/assets/firefox3.png)

1. Double-click ` **[!UICONTROL security.mixed_content.block_active_content]**` .

   The value changes from "True" to "False." When the value shows "False," you are finished. 

   ![Firefox security](/help/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/r-troubleshoot-composer/assets/firefox2.png)

We recommended that you restart your computer after changing this setting.

## Enabling mixed content in Microsoft Edge

If you're visiting a site via a secure connection, Edge verifies that the content on the web page has been transmitted safely.

If you are using the VEC with the latest version of Edge, you need to update your site settings. Visitors to your site do not need to complete these steps.

1. Click the lock or caution icon, then click **[!UICONTROL Site Permissions]**. 

   ![Site Permissions in Microsoft Edge](/help/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/r-troubleshoot-composer/assets/ms-edge.png)

1. Scroll to **[!UICONTROL Insecure content]**, then use the drop-down list to change "Block (default)" to "Allow".

   ![Insecure content](/help/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/r-troubleshoot-composer/assets/ms-edge-2.png)

1. Reload the VEC page.

You can add users and manage their permissions in the [!DNL Adobe Admin Console].

>[!NOTE]
>
>The information in this topic has been updated to give you a sneak peak at the UI changes coming in the Target Standard/Premium 20.6.1 release (July 2020). Most of the information presented in this topic applies to the current UI; however, options might be in slightly different locations.

>[!NOTE]
>
>[!UICONTROL Properties] and [!UICONTROL Permissions] functionality is available as part of the [!DNL Target] Premium solution. They are not available in [!DNL Target] Standard without a [!DNL Target] Premium license.
>You can tell whether your organization has a Standard or Premium license by clicking the [!UICONTROL Administration] link at the top of the [!DNL Target] UI.
>
>* **[!DNL Target] Standard Customers**: If you see the [!UICONTROL Users] tab ([!UICONTROL Administration > Users]) (and not the **[!UICONTROL Properties]** tab), your organization has a [!DNL Target] Standard license. [!DNL Target Standard customers should follow the instructions in this article to add users and assign permissions in the [!DNL Adobe Admin Console].
>
>* **[!DNL Target] Premium Customers**: If you see the [!UICONTROL Users] tab and the [!UICONTROL Properties] tab ([!UICONTROL Administration > Properties]), your organization has a [!DNL Target] Premium license. [!DNL Target] Premium customers should follow the instructions in [Enterprise user permissions](/help/administrating-target/c-user-management/property-channel/property-channel.md) and [Configure enterprise permissions](/help/administrating-target/c-user-management/property-channel/properties-overview.md) to add users and assign permissions in the [!DNL Adobe Admin Console].

>For detailed information about how to manage users and permissions, see [Manage products and profiles](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/manage-products-and-profiles.html) in the *Enterprise & Teams User Guide*.

When you get started with [!DNL Adobe Target], you will find IDs (ending in Adobe.com) pre-populated in your [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] account. These IDs are for members of [!DNL Adobe] teams so that they can assist you with your new account and with your use of [!DNL Adobe Target], should you need help. To get assistance, reach out to your Adobe teams in the usual way.

You will not see the new user listed on the [!UICONTROL Users] page until the user logs in using his or her [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] account and then logs in to [!DNL Target Standard/Premium].

By default all [!DNL Target] users start with observer permissions.

Admin users are identified in the [!UICONTROL Users] list. Contact one of the system admin users if you need your access level changed.

## Access the Adobe Admin Console {#access}

For tasks performed in the Adobe Admin Console, access the console by following these steps:

1. From within [!DNL Target], click **[!UICONTROL Administration]** > **[!UICONTROL Users]** > **[!UICONTROL Users Management]**.

   Or

   Go to [https://adminconsole.adobe.com/enterprise/](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/enterprise/), then sign in using your Adobe ID, if you have not already logged in.

1. (Conditional) If you have access to the [!DNL Admin Console for Enterprise] for more than one organization, click the user avatar in the right corner or the top navigation bar, then select the desired organization.

## Add users {#add-users}

All user management must be performed in the [!DNL Adobe Admin Console for Enterprise]. However, all of your existing users in [!DNL Target] will be migrated from [!DNL Target] to the [!DNL Admin Console for Enterprise].

1. [In the Admin Console](../../../administrating-target/c-user-management/c-user-management/user-management.md#section_79796E0227D048F59BAE0AB02E544EBE), click **[!UICONTROL Users]** > **[!UICONTROL Users]** to create new users or to edit existing users. 
1. Follow the instructions in [Manage Users and Groups in the Experience Cloud](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/help/users.html) in the *Enterprise User Guide*.

## Create user groups {#user-groups}

You can create user groups, such as Developers, Analysts, Marketers, Executives, etc., and then assign privileges across multiple Adobe products and workspaces. Assigning a new team member all the appropriate privileges across different Adobe products can be as easy as adding them to a specific user group.

1. [In the Admin Console](../../../administrating-target/c-user-management/c-user-management/user-management.md#section_79796E0227D048F59BAE0AB02E544EBE), click **[!UICONTROL Users]** > **[!UICONTROL User Groups]** to create new user groups or to edit existing groups. 
1. Follow the instructions in [Manage Users and Groups in the Experience Cloud](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/help/users.html) in the *Enterprise User Guide*.

## Specify roles and permissions {#roles-permissions}

Only system admins can set user roles in [!DNL Target]. For example, a Standard approver user cannot change an observer to an approver, without also having [!DNL Experience Cloud] Admin rights.

System admin users must add users to the system. Users are not automatically added. They are invited by email from the [!DNL Experience Cloud] and must confirm their email addresses before their accounts are registered.

1. [In the Admin Console](../../../administrating-target/c-user-management/c-user-management/user-management.md#section_79796E0227D048F59BAE0AB02E544EBE), click **[!UICONTROL Products]**, then select the name of the desired product.

1. Click the desired workspace (for example, Default Workspace).

   ![Default Workspace](/help/administrating-target/c-user-management/c-user-management/assets/default-workspace-new.png)

   The [!UICONTROL Users] tab displays all of the users in that workspace.

   ![configuration users](/help/administrating-target/c-user-management/c-user-management/assets/configuration_users-new-publisher.png)

1. Select the desired permissions role (Approver, Editor, or Observer) by using the drop-down list for each user in the [!UICONTROL Product Role] column.

   ![Product Role drop-down list](/help/administrating-target/c-user-management/c-user-management/assets/product-role-new.png)

   | Role | Description |
   |--- |--- |
   |Approver|Can create, edit, and activate or stop activities.|
   |Editor|Can create and edit activities before they are live, but cannot approve the launch of an activity.|
   |Observer|Can view activities, but cannot create or edit them.|
   |Publisher|Similar to the Observer role (can view activities, but cannot create or edit them). However, the Publisher role has the additional permission to activate activities.|

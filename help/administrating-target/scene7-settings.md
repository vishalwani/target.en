# Scene7 configuration {#scene-settings}

Target can be integrated with [!DNL Adobe Dynamic Media Classic] (formerly [!DNL Scene7]) to provide Digital Asset Management (DAM) in the Content Library.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Integrating [!DNL Target] with [!DNL Dynamic Media Classic] enables delivery of assets (as part of activities) uploaded to the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] assets folder. This integration does not enable access to all assets uploaded in [!DNL Dynamic Media Classic] for delivery in [!DNL Target] activities.

If you already have a [!DNL Dynamic Media] account, you can supply your existing credentials. If you do not have an account, you can request a restricted-use [!DNL Dynamic Media Classic] account at no additional charge from your [!DNL Adobe] representative. This account can be used for purposes restricted for use in [!DNL Target] only. This service is made available to customers for workflows needing image-swap functionality.

If this setting is not configured, the [!UICONTROL Swap Image offer] option within the activity creation workflow is not available. After this setting is configured, the option to swap/change image offers is available in both the [Visual Experience Composer (VEC) and in the Form-Based Experience Composer](../c-experiences/experiences.md#concept_A2E10F6AFB3D4AEAB6951EE14688848D). You can then leverage image offers with images that have been uploaded from the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] for use in [!DNL Target] activities.

If you want to reference a public image URL directly in an offer or custom code during activity creation, you should deploy the image to your own web servers and use your own URL in the code. There is no way to obtain the published URL of an image uploaded into the [!DNL Experience Cloud] to consume directly or outside of targeting workflows using [!DNL Target]. This functionality is not allowed, as per contract.

Note that the storage URL and the final publish URLs of images from [!DNL Dynamic Media] are different and one must *NOT* create offers using the storage link of images as delivery will not work in such cases. You must use the image offers capability as explained in our help documentation.

To integrate with [!DNL Dynamic Media Classic] ([!DNL Scene7]), you need to specify the following information.

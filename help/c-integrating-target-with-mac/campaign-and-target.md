# Integrate Target with Adobe Campaign{#integrate-target-with-adobe-campaign}

Use [!DNL Target] with [!DNL Adobe Campaign] to optimize email content.

To optimize your email content--for example, to display different offers for male and female recipients--you can create a redirect offer in [!DNL Target], then use [!DNL Adobe Campaign] to manage the email offers.

The integration takes place when the email is opened. When the customer opens the email, a call is made to [!DNL Target] and a dynamic version of the content appears. The content consists of a static image supported by all browsers. [!DNL Target] tracks the reaction to the offer at the audience or session level and that data is available in [!DNL Target] reports.

Target can track the following data:

* User agent 
* IP address 
* Geographical location 
* Segment associated with the visitor's ID in Target (subject to legal approval) 
* Data from [!DNL Campaign] Datamart

There are several limitations:

* Because only an image can be used, content cannot be personalized. 
* Tracking is not consolidated in [!DNL Adobe Campaign]. 
* No unified user experience.

  You must use both [!DNL Target] and [!DNL Campaign] to set up different parts of the integration:

    * The rawbox and the experience in [!DNL Target]

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >When using a rawbox and [!DNL Target], see the important security notice under [Create allowlists that specify hosts that are authorized to send mbox calls to Target](/help/administrating-target/hosts.md#allowlist). 

    * The delivery in [!DNL Campaign]

## Before You Begin {#section_FF19BF1BCA064260930BF6C141313B0E}

Before you use [!DNL Adobe Campaign] to set up your targeted email offers, set up the following in [!DNL Target]:

* Two or more [!DNL Target] redirect offers

  See [Create redirect offer](/help/c-experiences/c-manage-content/offer-redirect.md). 
* A Target activity with an experience for each offer and the desired [success metric](/help/c-activities/r-success-metrics/success-metrics.md).

  See [Redirect to a URL](/help/c-experiences/c-visual-experience-composer/redirect-offer.md).

Start the activity in [!DNL Target] before setting up the [!DNL Campaign] portion of the integration.

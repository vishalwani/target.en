>See [Ten common A/B testing pitfalls and how to avoid them](/help/c-activities/t-test-ab/common-ab-testing-pitfalls.md) for detailed information. In addition to the ideas presented in that article, keep this short list handy to avoid or fix these common testing and personalization pitfalls.

|Pitfall|Solution|
| --- | --- |
|Not having enough traffic to reach statistically significant results.|Use the Adobe Target [sample size calculator](https://docs.adobe.com/content/target-microsite/testcalculator.html) in advance to understand how long the test must run, and then run the test to completion.|
|Making a change that is too small or unnoticeable.|Make the change substantial enough so that it can be visible when you stand a few feet away from the screen.|
|Failing to align activities with business objectives.|Increase focus on the prioritization methodology and communicate that methodology to internal stakeholders.|
|Having little or no testing backlog.|Engage with internal stakeholders and allow them to submit tests that are aligned with key business goals.|
|Extending activity launches past deadlines|Improve documentation for activities and include specific details about the test setup.|
|Selecting activity success metrics data that don’t help with decision making.|Document all primary test metrics and include additional metrics to gain additional insights.|
|Making changes during the test that could impact results.|Maintain a calendar of upcoming promotions and site changes. Clearly communicate [!DNL Target] activity launches to avoid conflicts.|
|Changing test experiences or criteria close to an activity launch.|Request sign-off from key stakeholders early in the test activity process.|
|Concluding an activity before the results are statistically significant.|Verify test duration using the Adobe [sample size calculator](https://docs.adobe.com/content/target-microsite/testcalculator.html).|
|Receiving negative or flat results from a [!DNL Target] activity.|Confirm that the activity is worth testing.|
|Not hard coding the winning experience.|Use activity data to show value to get buy-in for hard-coding.|
|Not sharing results beyond the testing team.|Expand communications to include lunch and learns, develop a program dashboard, and schedule stakeholder meetings.|

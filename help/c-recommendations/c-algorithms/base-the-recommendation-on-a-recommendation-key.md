# Base the recommendation on a recommendation key

Recommendations based on keys use visitor behavior context to show relevant results in [!DNL Adobe Target] [!DNL Recommendations] activities. 

There are two types of Recommendations:

* **Popularity:** Lists items according to Most Viewed, Top Sold, and Top Metric. The key is empty for popularity criteria. 
* **Key-based:** Comprises the rest of the criteria. Recommendations offers a diverse set of choices with regard to the key type. The options range from "current item" to "profile parameters," which allow you to programmatically set the key of the values to recommend. You can test multiple criteria against each other by basing each criteria on a different key.

Each criteria is defined in its own tab. Traffic is split evenly across your different criteria tests. In other words, if you have two criteria, traffic is divided equally between them. If you have two criteria and two designs, traffic is split evenly between the four combinations. You can also specify a percentage of site visitors who see the default content, for comparison. In that case, the specified percentage of visitors see the default content, and the rest are split between your criteria and design combinations. 

1. Create a new criteria, or select an existing criteria and click **[!UICONTROL Edit]**.
1. To change the recommendation key, select the new key from the [!UICONTROL Recommendation Key] drop-down list, then click **[!UICONTROL Save]** or **[!UICONTROL Update]**.

   Because different logic maps to different recommendations keys, different recommendations lend themselves to placement on different types of pages. Refer to the following sections for more information about each recommendation key.

## Recommendation keys

The following recommendation keys are available from the [!UICONTROL Recommendation Key] drop-down list:

### Current Item {#current-item}

The recommendation is determined by the item the visitor is currently viewing. 

Recommendations display other items that might interest visitors who are interested in the specified item.

When this option is selected, the `entity.id` value must be passed as a parameter in the display mbox.

#### Logic (Criteria)

* [!UICONTROL Items with similar attributes]
* [!UICONTROL People Who Viewed This, Viewed That]
* [!UICONTROL People Who Viewed This, Bought That]
* [!UICONTROL People Who Bought This, Bought That]
* [!UICONTROL Site Affinity]

#### Where to use on your site

* Single-item pages, such as product pages.
* Do NOT use on null search results pages.

### Current Category {#current-category}

The recommendation is determined by the product category that the visitor is currently viewing.

Recommendations display items in the specified product category.

When this option is selected, the `entity.categoryId` value must be passed as a parameter to the display mbox.

#### Logic (Criteria)

* Top Sellers
* Most Viewed

#### Where to use on your site

* Single-category pages.
* Do NOT use on null search results pages.

### Custom Attribute {#custom}

Recommendation is determined by an item that is stored in a visitor's profile, using either user.*x* or profile.*x* attributes.

When this option is selected, the `entity.id` value must be present in the profile attribute.

When you base recommendations on custom attributes, you must select the custom attribute and then select the recommendation type.

You can perform real-time filtering on top of your own custom criteria output. For example, you can limit your recommended items to only those from a visitor's favorite category or brand. This gives you the power to combine off-line calculations with real-time filtering.

This functionality means that you can use [!DNL Target] to add personalization on top of your offline calculated recommendations or custom-curated lists. This combines the power of your data scientists and research with Adobe's tried-and-true delivery, run-time filtering, A/B testing, targeting, reporting, integrations, and more.

With the addition of inclusion rules on Custom criteria, this turns otherwise static recommendations into dynamic recommendations based a visitor's interests.

* Custom criteria are configurable, like other criteria in recommendations.
* You can use [collections](/help/c-recommendations/c-products/collections.md), [exclusions](/help/c-recommendations/c-products/exclusions.md), and [inclusions](/help/c-recommendations/c-algorithms/use-dynamic-and-static-inclusion-rules.md) (including the special rules for Price and Inventory) in the same way as any other criteria.

Possible use-cases include:

* You want to recommend movies from a custom-curated list, but only if the visitor hasn't already watched them.
* You want to run an offline algorithm and use the results to power your recommendations, but you need to ensure that out-of-stock items are never recommended.
* You want to include only items that are from this visitor's favorite category.

#### Logic (Criteria)

* [!UICONTROL People Who Viewed This, Viewed That]
* [!UICONTROL People Who Viewed This, Bought That]
* [!UICONTROL People Who Bought This, Bought That]
* [!UICONTROL Overall behavior]
* [!UICONTROL Most Viewed]
* [!UICONTROL Top Sellers]

If the key is a custom profile attribute and the algorithm type is Most Viewed or Top Sellers, a new drop-down list that displays called "Group By Unique Value Of" that has a list of known entity attributes (except ID, category, margin, value, inventory, and environment). This field is required.

#### Where to use on your site

* Can be used on any pages.

#### Custom recommendations key

You can base recommendations on the value of a custom profile attribute. For example, suppose that you want to display recommended movies based on the movie that a visitor most recently added to his or her queue.

1. Select your custom profile attribute from the **[!UICONTROL Recommendation Key]** drop-down list (for example, “Last Show Added to Watchlist”).
1. Then select your **[!UICONTROL Recommendation Logic]** (for example "People Who Viewed This, Viewed That").

   ![Create new criteria dialog box](/help/c-recommendations/c-algorithms/assets/create-new-criteria-1.png)

If your custom profile attribute doesn't directly match to a single entity ID, it is necessary to explain to [!DNL Recommendations] how you want the match to an entity to occur. For example, suppose that you want to display the top selling items from a visitor’s favorite brand.

1. Select your custom profile attribute from the **[!UICONTROL Recommendation Key]** drop-down list (for example, “Favorite Brand”).

1. Then select the **[!UICONTROL Recommendation Logic]** you want to use with this key (for example, "Top Sellers").

   The [!UICONTROL Group By Unique Value Of] option displays. 

1. Select the entity attribute that matches to the key you’ve chosen. In this case “Favorite Brand” matches to `entity.brand`.

   [!DNL Recommendations] now produces a “Top Sellers” list for each brand and shows the visitor the appropriate “Top Sellers” list based on the value stored in the visitor's Favorite Brand profile attribute.

### Favorite Category {#favorite-category}

The recommendation is determined by the category that has received the most activity, using the same method used for "most viewed item" except that categories are scored instead of products.

This is determined by recency/frequency criteria that works as follows:

* 10 points for first category view
* 5 points for every subsequent view

Categories visited for the first time are given 10 points. 5 points are given for subsequent visits to the same category. With each visit, non-current categories that have been viewed before are decremented by 1.

For example, viewing categoryA then categoryB in one session results in A: 9, B: 10. If you view the same items in the next session, the values change to A: 20 B: 9.

#### Logic (Criteria)

* [!UICONTROL Top Sellers]
* [!UICONTROL Most Viewed]

#### Where to use on your site

* General pages, such as home or landing pages and offsite ads.

### Last Purchased Item {#last-purchased}

The recommendation is determined by the last item that was purchased by each unique visitor. This is captured automatically, so no values need to be passed on the page.

#### Logic (Criteria)

* [!UICONTROL Items with similar attributes]
* [!UICONTROL People Who Viewed This, Viewed That]
* [!UICONTROL People Who Viewed This, Bought That]
* [!UICONTROL People Who Bought This, Bought That]
* [!UICONTROL Site Affinity]

#### Where to use on your site

* Home page, My Account page, offsite ads.
* Do NOT use on product pages or pages relevant to purchases.

### Last Viewed Item {#last-viewed}

The recommendation is determined by the last item that was viewed by each unique visitor. This is captured automatically, so no values need to be passed on the page.

#### Logic (Criteria)

* [!UICONTROL Items with similar attributes]
* [!UICONTROL People Who Viewed This, Viewed That]
* [!UICONTROL People Who Viewed This, Bought That]
* [!UICONTROL People Who Bought This, Bought That]
* [!UICONTROL Site Affinity]

#### Where to use on your site

* Home page, My Account page, offsite ads.
* Do NOT use on product pages or pages relevant to purchases.

### Most Viewed Item {#most-viewed}

The recommendation is determined by the item that has been viewed most often, using the same method as used for favorite category.

This is determined by recency/frequency criteria that works as follows:

* 10 points for first product view
* 5 points for every subsequent view
* At end of session divide all values by 2

For example, viewing surfboardA then surfboardB in one session results in A: 10, B: 5. When the session ends, you will have A: 5, B: 2.5. If you view the same items in the next session, the values change to A: 15 B: 7.5.

#### Logic (Criteria)

* [!UICONTROL Items with similar attributes]
* [!UICONTROL People Who Viewed This, Viewed That]
* [!UICONTROL People Who Viewed This, Bought That]
* [!UICONTROL People Who Bought This, Bought That]
* [!UICONTROL Site Affinity]

#### Where to use on your site

* General pages, such as home or landing pages and offsite ads.

### Popularity {#popularity}

The recommendation is determined by the popularity of items on your site. Popularity includes top sellers and top viewed by mbox data and, if you use Adobe Analytics, all of the metrics available in the product report. Items are ranked based on the Recommendation Logic you select.

#### Logic (Criteria)

* [!UICONTROL Top Sellers]
* [!UICONTROL Most Viewed]
* Product report metrics (if you are using Adobe Analytics)

#### Where to use on your site

* General pages, such as home or landing pages and offsite ads.

### Recently Viewed Items {#recently-viewed}

Uses the visitor's history (spanning sessions) to present the last *x* items the visitor has viewed, based on the number of slots in the design.

The Recently Viewed Items criteria now returns results specific to a given [environment](/help/administrating-target/hosts.md). If two sites belong to different environments and a visitor switches between the two sites, each site shows only recently viewed items from the appropriate site. If two sites are in the same environment and a visitor switches between the two sites, the visitor will see the same recently viewed items for both sites.

#### Where to use on your site

* General pages, such as home or landing pages and offsite ads.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Recently Viewed Items respects both Exclusions global settings and the selected Collection setting for the Activity. If an item is excluded by a global Exclusion, or is not contained in the selected Collection, it will not be displayed; therefore, when using a Recently Viewed Items criteria, the "All Collections" setting should generally be used.

## Recommendation logic

[!DNL Target Recommendations] uses sophisticated algorithms to determine when a visitor's actions qualify for the criteria set in your activity. The recommendation key determines the recommendations logic options that are available.

The following recommendation logic (criteria) are available from the [!UICONTROL Recommendation Logic] drop-down list:

### Items/Media with Similar Attributes {#similar-attributes}

Recommends items or media similar to items or media based on current page activity or past visitor behavior.

If you select Items/Media with Similar Attributes, you have the option to set content similarity rules.

Using content similarity to generate recommendations is especially effective for new items, which are not likely to show up in recommendations using People Who Viewed This, Viewed That, and other logic based on past behavior. You can also use content similarity to generate useful recommendations for new visitors, who have no past purchases or other historical data.

For more information, see [Content Similarity](/help/c-recommendations/c-algorithms/create-new-algorithm.md#similarity).

This logic can be used with the following recommendation keys:

* Current Item
* Last Item Purchased
* Last Viewed Item
* Most Viewed Item

### Most Viewed {#most-viewed-logic}

Displays the items or media that are viewed most often on your site.

This logic lets you display recommendations based on the most-viewed items on your site to increase conversions for other items. For example, a media site could display recommendations on its home page for its most-viewed videos to encourage visitors to watch additional videos.

This logic can be used with the following recommendation keys:

* Current Category
* Custom Attribute
* Favorite Category
* Popularity

### People Who Bought This, Bought That {#bought-bought}

Recommends items that are most often purchased by customers at the same time as the specified item.

This logic returns other products people purchased after buying this one; the specified product is not included in the results set.

This logic lets you increase cross-selling opportunities by displaying a recommendation on a shopping cart summary page, for example, that displays items that other buyers also purchased. For example if the visitor is purchasing a suit, the recommendation could display additional items other visitors purchased along with the suit, such as ties, dress shoes, and cufflinks. As visitors review their purchases, you provide them with additional recommendations.

This logic can be used with the following recommendation keys:

* Current Item
* Custom Attribute
* Last Purchased Item
* Last Viewed Item
* Most Viewed Item

### People Who Viewed This, Bought That {#viewed-bought}

Recommends items that are most often purchased in the same session that the specified item is viewed. This criteria returns other products people purchased after viewing this one, the specified product is not included in the results set.

This logic returns other products people purchased after viewing this one; the specified product is not included in the results set.

This logic lets you increase cross-selling opportunities by displaying a recommendation on a product page, for example, that displays items that other visitors who viewed the item purchased. For example if the visitor is viewing a fishing pole, the recommendation could show additional items other visitors purchased, such as tackle boxes, waders, and fishing lures. As visitors browse your site, you provide them with additional purchasing recommendations.

This logic can be used with the following recommendation keys:

* Current Item
* Custom Attribute
* Last Purchased Item
* Last Viewed Item
* Most Viewed Item

### People Who Viewed This, Viewed That {#viewed-viewed}

Recommends items that are most often viewed in the same session that the specified item is viewed.

This logic returns other products people viewed after viewing this one; the specified product is not included in the results set.

This logic lets you create additional conversion opportunities by recommending items that other visitors who viewed an item also viewed. For example, visitors who view road bikes on your site might also look at bike helmets, cycling kits, locks, and so forth. You can create a recommendation using this logic that suggests other products to help you increase revenue.

This logic can be used with the following recommendation keys:

* Current Item
* Custom Attribute
* Last Purchased Item
* Last Viewed Item
* Most Viewed Item

### Site Affinity {#site-affinity}

Recommends items based on the certainty of a relationship between items. You can configure this criteria to determine how much data is required before a recommendation is presented using the Inclusion Rules slider. For example, if you select very strong, the products with the strongest certainty of a match are recommended.

For example, if you set a very strong affinity and your design includes five items, three of which meet the strength of connection threshold, the two items that do not meet the minimum strength requirements are not displayed in your recommendations and are replaced by your defined backup items. The items with the strongest affinity display first.

For example an online retailer can recommend items in subsequent visits that a visitor has shown interest in during past sessions. Activity for each visitor's session is captured to calculate an affinity based on a recency and frequency model. As this visitor returns to your site, site affinity is used to display recommendations based on past actions on your site.

Some customers with diverse product collections and diverse site behaviors might get the best results if they set a weak site affinity.

This logic can be used with the following recommendation keys:

* Current Item
* Last Purchased Item
* Last Viewed Item
* Most Viewed Item

### Top Sellers {#top-sellers}

Displays the items that are included in the most completed orders. Multiple units of the same item in a single order are counted as one order.

This logic lets you create recommendations for top-selling items on your site to increase  conversion and revenue. This logic is especially suited for first-time visitors to your site.

This logic can be used with the following recommendation keys:

* Favorite Category
* Popularity

### User-Based Recommendations {#user-based}

Recommends items based off of each visitor's browsing, viewing, and purchasing history. These items are generally referred to as "Recommended for You."

This criteria lets you deliver personalized content and experiences to both new and returning visitors. The list of recommendations is weighted towards the visitor's most-recent activity and is updated in-session and become more personalized as the user browses your site.

Both views and purchases are used to determine the recommended items. The specified recommendation key (e.g. Current Item) is used to apply any inclusion rule filters you select. 

For example, you can:

* Exclude items that don't meet certain criteria (products out of stock, articles published more than 30 days ago, movies rated R, and so forth).
* Limit included items to a single category or to the current category.

This logic can be used with the following recommendation keys:

* Current Item
* Last Purchased Item
* Last Viewed Item
* Most Viewed Item

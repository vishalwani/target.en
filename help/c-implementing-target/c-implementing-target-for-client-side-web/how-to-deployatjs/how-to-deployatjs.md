# How to deploy at.js{#how-to-deploy-at-js}

Information about how to deploy the Adobe Target JavaScript library, at.js, using Adobe Launch, without a tag manager, or using Adobe Dynamic Tag Management (DTM).

You can deploy at.js using the following methods:

* **[Implement Target using Adobe Launch](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/how-to-deployatjs/cmp-implementing-target-using-adobe-launch.md)**: Launch is the next-generation tag management platform from Adobe and is the preferred method to implement Adobe Target. Launch gives customers a simple way to deploy and manage all of the analytics, marketing, and advertising tags necessary to power relevant customer experiences.
* **[Implement Target without a Tag Manager](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/how-to-deployatjs/implementing-target-without-a-tag-manager.md)**: You can implement Target without using a tag manager (Adobe Launch or Dynamic Tag Management).
* **[Implement Target using Dynamic Tag Management](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/how-to-deployatjs/implementing-target-using-dynamic-tag-management.md)**: You can implement Target using Adobe Dynamic Tag Management (DTM), Adobe's legacy tag manager. Adobe Launch is the preferred, up-to-date method for implementing Target and the at.js library. For new Target implementations, use Launch.
* **Implement Target using a third-party tag manager**: [Adobe Launch](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/how-to-deployatjs/cmp-implementing-target-using-adobe-launch.md) is the preferred method to implement Target; however, you can also implement Target using a third-party tag manager, such as Tealium, Ensighten, Google Tag, etc. For a list of benefits of using Launch, see [Advantages of implementing at.js using the Target Launch extension](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/how-to-deployatjs/cmp-implementing-target-using-adobe-launch.md#section_48B3F938B6F8491DAF798E0DB54EF304).

  However, if you know how to implement Target without a tag manager you can easily implement with a third-party tag manager instead of hard-coding at.js in the site code.

  Here are two relevant topics that will help you implement Target with a third-party tag manager:

  * [Before you implement](/help/c-implementing-target/c-considerations-before-you-implement-target/considerations-before-you-implement-target.md)
  * [Implement Target without a tag manager](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/how-to-deployatjs/implementing-target-without-a-tag-manager.md)

  Be sure to check the documentation for your third-party tag manager for more information.

To implement Target when using Single Page Apps (SPAs), see [Single Page Application implementation](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/how-to-deployatjs/target-atjs-single-page-application.md).

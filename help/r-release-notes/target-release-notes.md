# Target release notes (prerelease){#target-release-notes-prerelease}

This article contains prerelease information. Release dates, features, and other information are subject to change without notice. 

**Last Updated: August 5, 2020**

>* **Adobe Again Named a Leader in Gartner Magic Quadrant for Personalization Engines**: Adobe was once again named a Leader in the third-annual Gartner Magic Quadrant for Personalization Engines, 2020 report. The Gartner Magic Quadrant for Personalization Engines evaluated vendors across 15 criteria that fall into two categories: completeness of vision and ability to execute. [Read about it on The Adobe Blog](https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-again-named-leader-in-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-personalization-engines/).
>
>* **mbox.js deprecation**: On August 30, 2020, Adobe Target will no longer support the mbox.js library. Post August 30, 2020, all calls made from mbox.js will gracefully fail and impact your pages that have Target activities running by serving default content. We recommend that all customers migrate to the most recent version of the at.js library before this date to avoid any potential issues with your sites. For more information, see [How At.js Works](/help/c-implementing-target/c-implementing-target-for-client-side-web/c-how-atjs-works/how-atjs-works.md) and [Adobe Target Skill Builder: Developer chat, migrate Adobe Target's mbox.js to at.js](https://seminars.adobeconnect.com/ptdo6mfo6qn6/?proto=true).
>
>   Although, mbox.js is currently supported, we have not provided feature updates to this library since July 2017. The newer at.js provides many advantages over mbox.js. Among other benefits, at.js improves page load times for web implementations, improves security, and provides better implementation options for single page applications.
>
>   By moving all customers to at.js, our engineers and support staff will be able to provide you with new functionality and offer the support you have come to expect from Adobe.
>
>* **Target Announcements**: See the Target announcements page for information about upcoming events, including Target Skill Builder sessions, developer chats, webinars, and Target Coffee Break sessions. For more information, see [Target announcements](/help/r-release-notes/target-announcements.md).
